# ShopLyft Clothing Catalogue
This project presents the user with an interactive clothing catalogue to facilitate stock management. All users are able to search, sort, and filter by keyword (TODO: and by related terms), as well as by attribute, such as brand, size, gender, and type. Admin users are granted additional functionality to add, remove, and edit existing items in the current stock. Items are displayed by a short, descriptive title, as well as the amount in stock.
